# Area and Volume

Write a program that begins by reading a radius, r, from the user. The program will
continue by computing and displaying the area of a circle with radius r and the
volume of a sphere with radius r. Use the pi constant in the built in data types in your
calculations and round the output to the nearest whole number.

> **Hint**: The area of a circle is computed using the formula `area = πr^2`. The
volume of a sphere is computed using the formula `volume = 4πr^3 /3`.
